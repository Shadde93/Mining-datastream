    "## Mining datastream- \"TRIEST: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully-Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "Webscaled networks are highly dynamic as new vertices can arrive and leave at any time of the graphical model. That is why we need an efficient algorithm to keep track of the properties of the evolving network. Through edge insertions. \n",
    "\n",
    "TRIEST provides an unbiased estimator for the total number of global and local triangles over an evolving streaming graph. And maintains a small sample subgraph of a fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework we were instructed to choose one of three papers and implement the algorithm introduced in that paper. We chose to implement the Triésta-base and Triésta algorithm of the paper _\"TRIÉSTA: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully-Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size\"_. The problems we had to deal with was,\n",
    "- First, Implement reservoir sampling in order to exploit the available memory. \n",
    "- Second, Implement the Triésta base algorithm, that counts the triangles.\n",
    "- Third, Implement the Triesta improved algorithm, to get lower variance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This network contains of links between friends and family for each users of the website hamsterster.com. In total there are: 2,426 vertices (users), 16,631 edges (friendships) and 53,265 triangles.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### TRIEST\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline algorithm of TRIEST maintains a collection S of M edges from the stream. Randomly samples (reservoir sample) an edge from S with and replace it with an edge from the stream. Then decrease or increase the number of triangle counts involved with deletion or insertion of the new edge into S. The improved TRIEST algorithm is different from the basic one in terms of updating the count, where it weighs the counting and some other minor modifications resulting in lower variance estimations of the triangle count.\n"

This function returns true if M is greater or equal to t, else it uses the _FlipBiasedCoin_ function that returns true or false based on the input given to it. If it returns true then a random edge from the edge sample,\"Sample\\_S\", is deleted and the counters decremented. If the _FlipBiasedCoin_ returns False then this function will return False as well. \n",
    "- Third, _find\\_neighb_ function finds the neighbours for each node and computes the intersection of the neighbours for two nodes that has an edge, in order to find common neighbours. \n",
    "- Fourth, _UpdateCounters_ is the function responsible of either decrementing or adding the counters. This function basically decrements the counters if a given sign is '-' and increases the counters if it is '+'.\n",
    "- Fifth, _expected\\_value_ computes the estimated number of triangles by using a theorem introduced in the paper for the Triést algorithm.\n",
    "- Sixth, _run_ function that creates the algorithm by looking into the _SampleEdge_ function and if that function returns true then it will add the current edge to the edge sample and increase the counter. This function returns the local counter, global counter and the estimated value using the _expected\\_value_ function. "

    "- 1. The challenges we faced while implementing the algorithm were mostly to understand the theory. The implementing of the algorithm was not that hard. The part we got stuck on at the beggining were how to create the updatings of the counters. We didn't face any difficulties that was really hard to deal with. \n",
    "- 2. It is probably possible to parallelize the algorithm but that would lead to huge changes of the algorithm. The algorithm depends on a global counter that estimates the number of triangles. The global counter and the local counters are dependent of the information about the neighbourhood received from the nodes(vertices) of the edges. So, it is a process that goes hand in hand for the counters which would make it hard to parallelize. This means that workers has to communicate with each other in order to update and synchronize the counters for each time step. So, in other words it is difficult to parallelize this algorithm. \n",
    "- 3. The algorithm works with unbounded graph streams with help of the reservoir sampling method and maintaining a fixed memory space M. A unbounded stream can consequence in under-utilization of memory or memory shortage but in our case that is not possible since this algorithm does take the size/memory in to account.  \n",
    "- 4. The TRIEST algorithms are for insertion-only streams. But the fully-dynamic algorithm handles streams of edges that are inserted or deleted in any arbitrary order with help of random pairing (RP), an extention of the reservoir sampling that can handel deletions of edges. The main idea is to compensate the future insertions of edges after a deletion of the edges has occured, by using a counter."
